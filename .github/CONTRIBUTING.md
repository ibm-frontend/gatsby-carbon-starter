# Contributing to Awesomeness

This document serves as a reference guide for best practices when contributing to this project.

## Submitting Issues
- Avoid duplicate issues. Before submitting an issue, perform a search to see if a similar issue has already been submitted.
- Please follow and fully fill out the issue template that is generated when creating a new issue.
- When submitting an issue, ensure that the sidebar has been filled out to the best of your knowledge (pipeline, labels, estimate, assignee, etc).
- Issues that have a number of sub-items that need to be complete should use task lists to track the sub-items in the main issue comment.
- When submitting a browser bug, please include the browser, version, operating system, and operating system version.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible; they are immensely helpful.

## Pull Requests
- **DO NOT ISSUE A PULL REQUEST WITHOUT FIRST SUBMITTING AN ISSUE**
- Pull request titles should be descriptive, explaining at the high level what it is doing
- Please follow and fully fill out the pull request template that is generated when creating a new pull request.
- Please also follow our [Pull Request Guidelines](#issue-guidelines) when creating a new pull request.
- Pull requests should reference their related issues. If the pull request closes an issue, [please reference its closing from a commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/). Pull requests not referencing any issues will be closed.
- Commit messages _must_ begin with the [relevant emoji](#emoji-cheatsheet) describing what the commit does.
- Do not squash or rebase commits when submitting a Pull Request
- Ensure no Emoji tags are used in the title of the Pull Request

## Commit Messages
Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used.

Please follow the following template for commit messages:
```bash
:<emoji>: <subject>
```
`<emoji>` being the name of the [relevant emoji](#emoji-cheatsheet) describing the changes (without wrapping ::) and `<subject>` being the description of changes. Commit messages may have multiple emoji.

Example commits may look something like the following:

```bash
git commit -m ":art: Refactor lookup system"
```

```bash
git commit -m ":lock: Fix XSS vulnerability"
```

```bash
git commit -m ":new::boom: Require author in content types" -m "Previously working content types will now throw if author is not present, so this is a breaking change"
```

It's highly recommended to utilize the [gitmoji cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) to aid in formatting these messages easily.

## Emoji Cheatsheet
When writing commits, please start the commit message with an applicable Emoji. Emoji should not be used at the start of issue or pull request titles.
